write a function (paceSub) that takes three parameters (S, W, T). 
where S is a non-empty string of non-repeating characters, 
W is a string of characters present in S (sub-string of S) 
and T is the number of shifts for substituting characters of W in S
for example given S=abcde and W=b and T = 2, 
the resulting substituted character will be d (which is two shifts after the character "b" in S)
the function is to return a string of substituted characters.

Hints:
T is non-negative number
W and S are non-empty strings

Example:
paceSub("abcdefgh","cab", 3) => "fde"
paceSub("aiwtdhoursnyed", "tonsion", 4) => "unddhnd"
paceSub("olredtivswabu", "redet", 7) => "wabau"

Instructions:
1. In your terminal, navigate into the folder "pace-sub"
2. run the script command "npm install"
3. to run your test, use "npm run test-paceSub"

your test time should be less than 3s.
Good Luck
