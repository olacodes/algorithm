Given a non-empty array, if there is a place to split the array so that the sum of the numbers on one
side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side return the length of the two arrays as an array but
if there is no place to split the array, return -1


canBalance([1, 1, 1, 2, 1]) → [3,2]
canBalance([2, 1, 1, 2, 1]) → -1
canBalance([10, 10]) → [1,1]
