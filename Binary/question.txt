Write a lab to test the binary search algorithm.

Using the binary search algorithm, check if a given number is in a given sorted array of numbers.

Given the sorted array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]  and any number, the program
should return the following:

(1) If it finds the number in the array,
 =>The index of the number in the array
 =>The number of iterations taken for the algorithm to find the number

(2) If the number is not in the array,
 =>-1 for the index
 =>The number of iterations taken for the algorithm to find the number

The return format should be a JavaScript object of the form shown below

{
    "index" : index of the number in the array,
    "count" : number of iterations taken to find the number
}
For example
binarySearch([0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 22, 30, 35, 40], 15) → {index: 3, count: 3}
binarySearch([0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 22, 30, 35, 40], 11) → {index: -1, count: 4}
